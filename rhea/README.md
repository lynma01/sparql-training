This directory contains training material for querying the [Rhea](https://www.rhea-db.org/) resource with SPARQL.  
See [SWAT4HCLS_2019](./SWAT4HCLS_2019) directory for our first public Rhea SPARQL training.


# What is Rhea?
[Rhea](https://www.rhea-db.org/) is an expert curated knowledgebase of chemical and transport reactions of biological interest 
that can be used for enzyme annotation and omics-related analysis 

Rhea uses the [ChEBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi) (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest) ontology of small molecules to 
precisely describe reactions participants and their chemical structures. 

Rhea is used directly in [UniProtKB](https://www.uniprot.org/) to describe the chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes.

# What is SPARQL?
[SPARQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL) (the SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is a query language for 
[RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework), a core Semantic Web technology from the W3C. 

# Rhea SPARQL endpoint

Users can query Rhea RDF data using SPARQL at the [Rhea SPARQL endpoint](https://sparql.rhea-db.org/sparql).
