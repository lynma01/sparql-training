This directory contains a Jupyter notebook ([rhea_tutorial_SWAT4HCLS_2019.ipynb](./rhea_tutorial_SWAT4HCLS_2019.ipynb)) which is the practical part of the **SPARQLing Rhea tutorial** presented at the 12th International [**SWAT4HCLS**](http://www.swat4ls.org/) (**S**emantic **W**eb **A**pplications and **T**ools for **H**ealth**c**are and **L**ife **S**ciences)  Conference (December 9, 2019 - Edinburgh, Scotland).  
It is part of the [Tutorial: Querying SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics resources with SPARQL](http://www.swat4ls.org/workshops/edinburgh2019/programme/tutorials/).

The corresponding slides are available at [edu.isb-sib.ch](https://edu.isb-sib.ch/course/view.php?id=424)

You can run the *rhea_tutorial_SWAT4HCLS_2019.ipynb* notebook in your own Jupyter installation.  
**Without Jupyter, you can also simply use *rhea_tutorial_SWAT4HCLS_2019.ipynb* as a list of SPARQL queries that you can execute in the specified SPARQL endpoints.** 

## Installation

- How to install the [Jupyter software](https://jupyter.org/install)

- To be executed in Jupyter, the *rhea_tutorial_SWAT4HCLS_2019.ipynb* notebook needs a **Python3 kernel** 
and uses the **SPARQLWrapper** and **pandas** python libraries:

| Python library | Description | Useful link |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **SPARQLWrapper** |SPARQLWrapper is a wrapper around a SPARQL service. It helps in creating the query URI and, possibly, convert the result into a more manageable format. The package is licensed under W3C license. | https://rdflib.github.io/sparqlwrapper/ and https://pypi.org/project/SPARQLWrapper/ |
|**pandas** | pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with structured (tabular, multidimensional, potentially heterogeneous) and time series data both easy and intuitive. |  https://pypi.org/project/pandas/  |
